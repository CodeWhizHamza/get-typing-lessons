# Get lessons from typingtestnow.com

In this project, I have used puppeteer to get data from the websites.

1. I get links of lessons from main page
2. Then I save these links in links.json file
3. I then go to each link
4. I then scrap for the lesson text
5. Then I save the text in lessons/lesson-(lesson-number).txt file
